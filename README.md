#Lens Configurable

I developed this piece of software during my internship at Lord Wilmore in July 2017 and was eventually integrated into Lord Wilmore's Magento platform. With this Lens configurable, clients shopping for glasses on Lord Wilmore's site can personalize their lenses with the different lens features available. After a client has chosen a particular frame model he would then use this software to decide every detail of the lens from extra treatments and lens reductions to prescription specifications.  

This repository does not include any magento code. I developed this software separate from Magento in order to later integrate it into LordWilmore's Magento platform. Therefore, this repository contains the HTML, CSS and Javascript code that shows most of the Lens Configurable's design and functionality. As a result, to run this software, simply fork all the files and open the index.html file on your browser.
